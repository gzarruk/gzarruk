I am a Civil and Environmenatl Engineer with M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in envorinmenatl fluid dynamics. More specifically in exprimental fluid dynamics. That is where my love for data comes from. I have worked in a wide variety of fields: turbulence, naval hydrodynamics, coastal engineering, multiphase-flows, sub-surface flows, and software development for the industrial sector.

I currently work at the intersection of **engineering, digital transformation**, and **data-driven decision-making** within a leading services company in the energy sector. 

I am what typically called an industrial data scientist. But spend most of my time orchestrating the building process of industrial digital solutions and the putting together the pizes required to build them, both from a technical and organizational stand point.


## What I am good at

Working with complex data sets and complex problems. Figuring out how how to put in motion a solution. 

## What I like

I really enjoy using digital signal processing methods to extract information from data. 

In my personal time I like excersing for endurance sports, competing in Ironmans and marathons.

Food is my weakness but I compensate with training ðŸ˜Š.

## What helps me be my best:

Working with doers that have a clear purpose.

## What I donâ€™t like

People that complain to me about things I can't control.

## How best to work with me:

Bring me a solution to your problem and I'll do what I can to help.
